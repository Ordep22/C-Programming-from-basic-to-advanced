Ths operations with strings can be most usefull in c

â€¢ Operations with string
 - strcpy // Copy a value to a string
 - strcat() //Concatenetes a tow strings
 - strcmp() // Comper tow strings and return  True if that one was differents
 - strchr() // find the first ocour of the character in a string
   - This function retur a string from the fistr ocour of the charater to end
     of the string argment
 - strtok() // Return the subs strings from the original string from a specific character
 - strlen() //Retunr the size of the input string
   #Most important:
        The strlen() funtcion is used to determine the length of a string (excluding null terminator).
        In contrast, the sizeof() function is used to determine the size in bytes of a variable or data type
        (including the null terminator fo strings)
